### 1. Install dependencies

It is encouraged to use **pnpm** so the husky hooks can work properly.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Run the development server

You can start the server using this command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.tsx`.

I used [![this](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/theodorusclarence/ts-nextjs-tailwind-starter)](https://github.com/theodorusclarence/ts-nextjs-tailwind-starter/stargazers) boilerplate my work starts from 'feat: init commit'

The boilerplate includes some tailwind config but I used mui own styling as it was the faster way

For caching I used react-query

The alphavantage free plan is very limited if you have got issue about reaching the limit try to ask a new api key or use VPN
